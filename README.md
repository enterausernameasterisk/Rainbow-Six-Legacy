## Usage

> Legacy is not fully plug-and-play and requires set-up:

- To achieve multiplayer capability, you will have to self-host through LAN, you can do this by using something like Radmin VPN.
- Skins, packs and cosmetics cannot be earned and are all automatically unlocked.

> Our servers are officially up as of 9/26/24, you can connect through Radmin:

- `Network Name: Rainbow Six Legacy`
- `Network Password: ShadowLegacy`
